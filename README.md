# Ethereum-smart-contract-test-project
A SIMPLE APP THAT EXCHANGES ETHEREUM TOKENS

***********************************************************************************
DESCRIPTION
***********************************************************************************

The aim of this project was to create a simple dummy app that can exchange Ethereum
tokens.

I undertook the project to learn more about Ethereum blockchain and smart 
contracts in general using Solidarity and the Truffle Suite.

Ganache network was used to run this project and in test mode, while Chai Mocha
was used for automated testing.

The app must be run in an Etherum browser such as Metamask whose extension is 
available in chrome.
